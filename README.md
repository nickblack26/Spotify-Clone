# Spotify Clone

This spotify clone uses the Spotify API, NEXT & React libraries, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Recoil State Management library](https://recoiljs.org) and [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org).

## Why NEXT.js?

NEXT is a popular Javascript framework that has a built in router and allows for server side rendering which makes your website more performent. I also chose NEXT because it allowed me to leverage their middleware technology, which allowed me to redirect the user to login before the page was loaded.
